# Bank-Marketing-Classification-using-several-Pattern-Recognition-methods
Bank Marketing Classification using Logistic Regression, Ada Boost, Random Forests, Radial Basis Function and Support Vector Machine

Dataset can be downloaded from the following web link:

http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bank+Marketing

Following pattern recognition methods are compared:

1. Logistic regression
2. Ada Boost
3. Random forests
4. Radial basis functions
5. Support vector machines

This is done using double cross-validation on 
1. Feature selection: filter approach - ChiSquare Test
2. Parametrized method with varying parameters according to the method used.

 
Results are tabulated during training and box plots are displayed for each method according to mean error and variance on accuracy metric. 
Training and testing results are compared.
